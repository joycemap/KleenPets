Problem Statement
1. Pet owners cannot find groomers near them, especially those with home services
2. Groomers, especially smaller outfits, don't have a dedicated platform to showcase their services without spending

Solution
Kleenpets Pet Groomer Finder
In a single app, pet owners can view pet groomers and all the pertinent information (name, address, contact information, whether home services are provided, description of services, price) related to the groomers.
Groomers can showcase their services to a select group of customers who are specifically looking for services that they provide.  Because customers can send contact groomers directly via email or phone, it can be a lead generation tool for groomers to build their businesses.

User Stories
1. As a pet owner of a very shy pet, I cannot get my pet into the crate to take him to the groomers.  I need to see a shortlist of groomers who are willing to come to my home.
2. As a pet owner, I need a central online directory of groomers instead of clicking on individual links on the search engines.
3. As a grooming business owner, I need an online presence so that pet owners can find out about me, without having to invest in a website.
4.  As a mobile groomer operating independently, I am not always at my business location. I need to potential customers to reach me wherever I am, and to highlight the mobile service I have.
